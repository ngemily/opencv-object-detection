Background
----------

### OpenCV

See [Basic Image Container][mat1] and [How to Scan Images][mat2] for basics on
how images are stored in memory and how to work with them.

### Sobel Operator

This project uses the Sobel operator for edge detection.  The basic principle is
that on one side of an edge, the pixels will be a markedly different intensity
than on the other side.  Thus, maximizing derivatives across pixels correlates
well with finding edges.

See [Wikipedia][sobel-wiki] for background on the Sobel operator.  See the
[OpenCV tutorial][sobel-opencv] for an example.  NB: the method used here to
combine x- and y-derivatives is slightly different from that used in the
tutorial.

The core of it is simply an instance of [kernel-wiki][image kernel] computation,
which is like convolution in signal processing.  See [this demo][kernel-demo]
for a concise explanation and live demo.  Image kernels or filters are the basis
of a diverse set of transformations that can be performed on an image simply by
relating each pixel to its neightbours.  It is also a conveniently regular
computation.

### Image Moments

This project uses image moments to characterize objects.  For background, see
[Wikipedia][moment-wiki] and for more depth, the paper presenting this idea
"Visual pattern recognition by moment invariants" by Ming-Kuei Hu.

It may be odd the think about caculating the moment of an image, but it is just
like any other scalar function of two variables.  The independent variables x
and y are the position of a pixel, and the dependent variable or value of the
function is the pixel's intensity.

Build
-----

This project uses CMake to handle the build process.  To build, go to any empty
directory and run CMake on this directory.  This will generate a Makefile that
can be used to build the project.

    mkdir -p build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Run it.  There are a number of sample images in the `imgs/` folder.

    ./DisplayImage <path to img>
